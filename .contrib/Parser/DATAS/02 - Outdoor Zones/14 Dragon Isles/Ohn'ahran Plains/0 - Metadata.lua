The centaur initially warred with the green flight, but after realizing that they were evenly matched, the two races agreed to share the region, with the green dragons inhabiting the groves while the centaur dominated the plains. However, as the dragons left the isles after the Great Sundering, the centaur have been left to develop their culture in isolation for ten thousand years.",
