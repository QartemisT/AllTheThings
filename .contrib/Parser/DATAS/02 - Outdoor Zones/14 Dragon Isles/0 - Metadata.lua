During the Great Sundering, much of the land's magic was drained away and the dragons were forced to leave their homeland in the care of the titanic watchers, the drakonid, the dragonspawn, and the dryads that were left behind.\n\nThe watchers used the Beacon of Tyrhold to hide the Isles away from all outsiders, as well as the dragons themselves. When a time came when elemental energy resurged and the dragons could be drawn home to reestablish their kingdom, the watchers would light the Beacon and reveal the Isles to the world once more.",
